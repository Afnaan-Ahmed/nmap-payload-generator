# Nmap-Payload-Generator

## Description

This Python script simplifies the process of generating Nmap payloads by allowing users to input their desired command and switches, resulting in a ready-to-use Nmap command for network scanning. It provides a user-friendly interface for quickly creating customized Nmap scans.

## Features

- Interactive command-line interface (CLI) for inputting Nmap command and switches.
- Automatically generates Nmap payloads based on user input.
- Streamlines the process of creating complex Nmap scans.
- Saves time and reduces the risk of command errors.
